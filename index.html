        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <div id="about_text">
            <p> Hello! I'm Albert Einstein. Born in 1879 in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, my journey in physics began early and has taken me to many fascinating corners of the universe - at least theoretically! Perhaps you've heard of my theory of relativity or the famous equation, E=mc^2? Over the years, I've been privileged to delve into the mysteries of the cosmos, earning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for my work on the photoelectric effect. Outside of science, I cherish music, playing the violin, and advocating for peace and civil rights. Throughout my life, I've always believed in the power of curiosity and imagination, and I encourage everyone to never stop asking questions.

            <h3>The Theory of Relativity:</h3>
            <p>This consists of the Special Relativity and General Relativity theories. The former, introduced in his 1905 paper, revolutionized the way we understand time, space, and the speed of light. It gave birth to the iconic equation E=mc ^2, which describes the relationship between an object's energy (E) and its mass (m). General Relativity, published a decade later, offers a new understanding of gravitation, suggesting that massive objects curve the spacetime around them, leading to what we perceive as gravitational attraction.</p>

        <div class="experiences">
            <h3>Photoelectric Effect:</h3>
            <p>This is one of Einstein's most celebrated works in quantum physics. In 1905, the same year he proposed the theory of special relativity, Einstein explained the phenomenon where metals emit electrons when light shines on them. He proposed that light could be thought of as packets of energy or "quanta" (later called photons). For this work, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. The photoelectric effect laid a foundation for quantum mechanics and was crucial in the development of modern electronics, including devices like solar cells.</p>

                <p>Have you ever felt the universe's rhythm? As I explored light and relativity, I saw a dance of energy and matter. The equation E=mc is more than symbols; it's the song of the cosmos. In this grand tapestry, everything is interconnected, playing its part in the universal symphony.</p>
